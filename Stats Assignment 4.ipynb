The main difference is we have to calculate the expected counts of each cell in a 2-dimensional table instead of a 1- dimensional table. To get the expected count for a cell, multiply the row total for that cell by the column total for that cell and then divide by the total number of observations. We can quickly get the expected counts for all cells in the table by taking the row totals and column totals of the table, performing an outer product on them with the np.outer() function and dividing by the number of observations:"],"metadata":{"id":"8HLtJ3ahz9fB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["expected =  np.outer(df2[\"row_totals\"][0:2],\n","                     df2.loc[\"col_totals\"][0:4]) / 395.0\n","expected = pd.DataFrame(expected)\n","expected.columns = [\"Bachelors\",\"High School\",\"Masters\",\"Ph.d.\"]\n","expected.index = [\"Female\",\"Male\"]\n","expected"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":112},"id":"FloaIGwRzwRm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645942671172,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Deepjyoti Saikia","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj3rP50QJkctiUyQsC_q4DKXvKVOX48dfsTeT0nuA=s64","userId":"17730780662127609499"}},"outputId":"dc748ad8-5773-4775-fa3c-6c33ff087b57"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-5012fe6a-d6dd-4e90-9676-825040a32f2b\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Bachelors</th>\n","      <th>High School</th>\n","      <th>Masters</th>\n","      <th>Ph.d.</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Female</th>\n","      <td>49.868354</td>\n","      <td>50.886076</td>\n","      <td>50.377215</td>\n","      <td>49.868354</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Male</th>\n","      <td>48.131646</td>\n","      <td>49.113924</td>\n","      <td>48.622785</td>\n","      <td>48.131646</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-5012fe6a-d6dd-4e90-9676-825040a32f2b')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-5012fe6a-d6dd-4e90-9676-825040a32f2b button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
